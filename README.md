# ChatGPT-like React Interface

## Project Overview

This project is a frontend application built with **React**, inspired by the ChatGPT interface. Special feature added - **Threaded context**

## Key Features

- New Chat Initialization

- Sub-Tab Functionality
  Create *sub-chats* from any message in a parent conversation. Each sub-tab inherits the context of the parent chat up to the branching point, so this  allows focused exploration without losing prev context context. (inspired from google docs)

- Dark Mode
- Gemini Flash 2.0 API Integration - context of previous 6 chats(hardcoded) always remembers

## Learning Objective

This project is built as a hands-on learning tool to deeply understand React. It follows the official React documentation and learning path from [react.dev/learn](https://react.dev/learn).
There is much to learn, and am venturing forward.
